   DISCLAIMER:
     THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY SAS INSTITUTE INC. AS A SERVICE TO
     ITS USERS.  IT IS PROVIDED "AS IS".  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES,
     EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE MATERIALS OR CODE
     CONTAINED HEREIN.

   PURPOSE:
     The %CLASSIFY macro uses the OUT= data set from the LOGISTIC or
     PROBIT procedure to produce a data set containing individual-level
     predicted probabilities as multiple variables on the original
     observations.  The output data set also contains the predicted
     response level based on a maximum-predicted-probability decision
     rule.  A threshold on the maximum predicted probability can be set
     so that an observation is not classified if no predicted
     probability exceeds the threshold.  Both binary- and
     ordinal-response variables are allowed.  The resulting data set can
     easily be used with the FREQ procedure to create a classification
     table comparing observed and predicted classifications.
                                                                      
   REQUIRES:
     Only base SAS software (Version 6 or later) is required.

   USAGE:
     You must first use the LOGISTIC or PROBIT procedure to fit a model 
     and create an OUT= data set containing predicted probabilities.
     Use the OUTPUT statement in either of these two procedures and
     specify the P= option (see the LOGISTIC or PROBIT documentation in
     the SAS/STAT User's Guide).  Note that OUT= data sets created using
     "events/trials" syntax (e.g. MODEL R/N = ...;) or using a BY 
     statement cannot be processed with the %CLASSIFY macro.  
     
     Submit this file to define the %CLASSIFY macro.  You may then 
     invoke the macro to process the output data set from LOGISTIC or 
     PROBIT.  The EXAMPLE section below shows how to invoke the macro.

     The following parameters are required when using the macro:

     data=        Name of LOGISTIC or PROBIT OUT= data set.  If not 
                  specified, the last data set created is used.
     response=    Name of response variable used in LOGISTIC or PROBIT.
     p=           Name of PREDICT= variable in OUT= data set.

     The following parameters are optional:

     threshld=0   Minimum predicted probability which must be attained
                  for an observation to be classified into a response
                  level.  The specified value must be between 0 and 1.
     predname=_predlvl
                  Names the variable in the OUT= data set containing the
                  predicted response level.  Do not use the same name as
                  given in the P= parameter.  If not specified, the
                  variable is named _PREDLVL.
     out=classout Names the output data set containing individual-level
                  predicted probabilities and the predicted response
                  level.  If not specified, the data set is named
                  CLASSOUT.
    
   PRINTED OUTPUT:
     Below is the output from the EXAMPLE.  The PSYMP variable contains
     the predicted classification.  The variables NONE, MILD, and SEVERE
     give the predicted probabilities for each of the corresponding
     response levels.  Note that they sum to 1.0 within an observation.

     The following table was generated by PROC FREQ to compare the 
     predicted and actual response classifications.  Using the maximum 
     predicted probability to classify observations, (132+96)/387 = 59% 
     of the observations were correctly classified.  Note, however, that 
     this will tend to be an optimistic estimate since the observations 
     being classified were also used to fit the model, resulting in 
     bias.

   DETAILS:
     The format of the OUT= data set produced by the LOGISTIC and PROBIT
     procedures does not lend itself well to the problem of classifying 
     observations into response levels.  This is especially so when the 
     response variable is ordinal, in which case there are k-1 output 
     observations for each input observation.  In this block of output 
     observations, the P= variable contains the first k-1 cumulative
     predicted probabilities, Pr(Y<=j), j=1,2,...,k-1.  The predicted
     probability of being in the j-th response level must be obtained by
     subtracting the predicted probability of being in the (j-1)st
     level:
        
        Pr(Y=j) = Pr(Y<=j) - Pr(Y<=j-1) ,   j=2,3,...,k

     Once these individual-level predicted probabilities are obtained, 
     you can then obtain a predicted classification of the observation 
     by classifying it into the response level with the largest 
     predicted probability.  You might want to prevent the
     classification of an observation if its largest predicted
     probability does not exceed a threshold that you specify.

     The %CLASSIFY macro does all of this for you.  The output data set 
     that it creates has as many observations as the data set that was 
     input to the LOGISTIC or PROBIT procedure.  Added to each original 
     observation are k variables containing the predicted probabilities 
     for each of the k response levels.  The names of these variables
     are constructed from the original response level names using the
     rules described in the ID Statement section of the TRANSPOSE
     procedure (See the SAS Procedures Guide).

     Any additional statistics created with the OUTPUT statement, such
     as XBETA= or STD= are included in the output data set.

   LIMITATIONS:
     Limited error checking is done.  Be sure that you correctly specify
     all options.  It is recommended that you do not process the OUT=
     data set from LOGISTIC or PROBIT in any way before using this
     macro.  In particular, do not drop the response variable or the
     predicted probability variable from the OUT= data set. 

     This macro cannot be used on an OUT= data set that was obtained 
     using:
      
        1) a BY statement.
     or
        2) "events/trials" syntax in the MODEL statement.
     
   MISSING VALUES:
     If values of the P= variable in %CLASSIFY's DATA= data set are
     missing, the individual-level predicted probabilities will be 
     missing in the OUT= data set.
      
   EXAMPLE:
     In this example (from the PROBIT chapter of the SAS/STAT User's
     Guide), the response is a three-level ordinal variable.  The 
     %CLASSIFY macro processes the OUT= data set from PROC PROBIT and 
     creates the output data set of predicted probabilities.  A
     classification table comparing predicted and actual response
     levels is created using PROC FREQ.
